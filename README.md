A place to build toys for kitties

Hector and Sophie are bored living in a New York City apartment, so I thought it woud be a good idea to design and build some innovative toys for them

Please send me your ideas!
Because I really don't know where to get started with this idea.
It's a brilliant idea, but executing it is the problem.

I'm still waiting.
